1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
So the human race is about to enter a totally data-minded existence.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:08,000
Education happens to be, today, the world's most data-minable industry by far.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,240
So maybe one day healthcare will be up there when they have little nanobots

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,000
that are in your bloodstream that are doing real-time analysis.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,400
So Newton today gets 5 to 10 million actionable data per student per day.

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,200
If you tag all of your content and you do it down to the atomic concept level,

7
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,200
down to the sentence, down to the clause, you unlock an incredible amount of trapped, hidden data.

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,000
Everything in education is correlated to everything else.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,800
Every single concept is correlated in a predictable way to everything else.

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,800
Using psychometrics, right?

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,800
You do a little bit of work for Newton and we use just the established science of psychometrics

12
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,800
to cascade out hundreds of other data, right?

13
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,800
So we can produce incredible quantities of data per user per day.

14
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,800
It's really, really hard to get that, okay?

15
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,800
For every one of the students, we can figure out within a few hours what they're strong at

16
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,800
and what they're weak at at the beginning of the course, right?

17
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,800
So we can produce a unique syllabus for each student each day, literally unique.

18
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,800
There's not enough time in the universe for any two students to have the same syllabus on any one day.

19
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,800
So we know you're going to fail. We know it in advance and we can prevent it in advance.

20
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,800
Let's go find a group of people who are psychometrically equivalent to that kid.

21
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,800
They learn the same ways, they have the same learning styles, they know the same stuff

22
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,800
because Newton can figure out things like you learn math best in the morning between 8.40 and 9.13 a.m.

23
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,800
You learn science best in 42-minute bite sizes.

24
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,800
The 44-minute market click rate always begins to decline.

25
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,800
You start missing questions. You normally get right.

26
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:21,800
You learn social studies best with video clips or 22% video to 78% text or whatever your optimal cocktail of fun.

27
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,800
We literally have more data about our students than any company has about anybody else, about anything.

28
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,800
This is a course at ASU. They had to change their semester structure into a modular semester structure

29
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,800
because we were suddenly telling things like if you give this woman here the final right now, she'll get an A.

30
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,800
It's only 14 days into the course. I promise you she'll get an A.

31
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,800
They all look like fleas, but that's all in an individual learning path.

32
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,800
Notice that some of them are going really fast, some are going really slow.

33
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:45,800
You can look at some of those students and think, boy, that poor schmuck is really in a lot of trouble.

34
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:50,800
So where we think we're going with this, talk about it as kind of a joke, but it really should work, is like a food diary.

35
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,800
You tell us what you had for breakfast every morning at the beginning of the semester.

36
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,800
By the end of the semester, we should be able to tell you what you had for breakfast

37
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,800
because you always do better on the days you have scrambled eggs.

38
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,800
And more importantly, we should be able to tell you what you should have for breakfast.
