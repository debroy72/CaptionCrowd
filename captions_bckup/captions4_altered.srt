1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
This stick has been dry aged with salt,

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,360
and we're gonna cut into it.

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,060
Salting a steak prior to cooking

4
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:07,100
is usually limited to a couple days,

5
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,960
and honestly, I had no idea

6
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,760
if the end product will be edible.

7
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,520
After a month, it's lost 20% of its weight

8
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,880
and is hard as the rock.

9
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,060
But slicing into it, eye was shocked to find

10
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,680
what looked like perfectly dry aged beef.

11
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,680
I added no seasonings, sear, buttter, herbs, and baste.

12
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,980
Part of me was expecting it to taste like beef jerky,

13
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,760
but it was diply seasoned, tender, and surprisingly great.
