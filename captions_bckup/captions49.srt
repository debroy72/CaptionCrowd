00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
What is quantum computing?

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:05,180
Quantum computing is a new type of computing architecture.

3
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:08,760
They'll make our devices millions of times faster than they are today.

4
00:00:08,760 --> 000:00:13,560
In order to solve a problem, today's computer must run through all possible solutions

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,560
until it finds a single one that works.

6
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:20,400
For example, if we're looking for a name in a phone book with seven billion names,

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,000
we'd have to go through each name one by one until we found a match.

8
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:27,400
Similarly, classical computers work using bits,

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,600
single pieces of information that exists either a one or a zero.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,300
Quantum bits or Q-bits, however, can exist as both a zero and a one simultaneously.

11
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:42,000
This means a quantum computer can check all possible solutions to a problem at one time.

12
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:48,880
For example, just 30 Q-bits can simulate 2 to the 30 or 1 billion possibilities in a split second.

13
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:54,080
And this is awesome for solving huge problems that are virtually an infinite number of possible answers.

14
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,940
Problems that simply cannot be solved by today's computers.

15
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,800
But this same superpower will also pose a major threat to cybersecurity.

16
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:07,200
The encryption algorithms of today rely on massive math problems that are near impossible to solve,

17
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,800
like factoring numbers hundreds of digits long.

18
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,000
A single quantum computer, however, could easily decrypt any piece of sensitive information

19
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,600
and render our entire system of cybersecurity obsolete.

20
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,600
That said, quantum computers will likely also allow us to create new quantum methods of encryption.

21
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,200
So I'm not too worried about that.

22
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:32,200
Still, that begs the question, will the first quantum computer be used for good or evil?
