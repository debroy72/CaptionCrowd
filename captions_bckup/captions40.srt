00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
E-Sports is the massive world around video games.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
E-Sports started at UCI with our gaming club and it's been our dream for many, many years to create an E-Sports program.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The UCI E-Sports program is based on four pillars. First, competition, second, academics and research, community and entertainment.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Part of our program is obviously the extremely big scholarship piece.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We've been recruiting from some of the top players in the nation.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We were able to successfully recruit five to six of the best League of Legends players that we could find that were also really good students.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We're creating a brand new program so with it comes a ton of opportunity, you're going to all have a huge influence on this, right?

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Besides the fact that it's a really prestigious school to be able to attend in the first place, I've been looking for an avenue to further my life after committing so much time into just playing League of Legends competitively.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
We are going to have a beautiful new 3500 square foot E-Sports arena.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Here we go.

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It's been a long road to get to the point where we're actually getting things delivered to the arena. We are very excited to launch this program.

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,000
One, two, three, Zot Zot Zot!

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And E-Sports is open!

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Our goal is to unite the gaming community in Southern California and be the best place for high level play in video games.

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
There is no ceiling to how big and successful this program can be.
