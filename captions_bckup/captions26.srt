00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
Corporate accounts payable, Nina speaking.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, Peter. What's happening?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,500
Uh, we have sort of a problem here.

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:13,500
Yeah, you apparently didn't put one of the new cover sheets on your TPS reports.

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,000
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry about that. I forgot.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Mmm, yeah.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
You see, we're putting the cover sheets on all TPS reports now before they go out.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,500
Did you see the memo about this?

9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:31,500
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I have the memo right here. I just forgot.

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,500
But it's not shipping out till tomorrow, so there's no problem.

11
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:41,500
Yeah. If you could just go ahead and make sure you do that from now on, that would be great.

12
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,500
And I'll go ahead and make sure you get another copy of that memo.

13
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,500
Okay?

14
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,500
Yeah, no, I have the memo. I've got it. It's right here.

15
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,500
Hello, Phil. What's happening?

16
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,500
I see a bar here.

17
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,500
Nope.

18
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,500
Hi. Uh, could you turn that down just a little bit?

19
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:11,500
I was told that I could listen to the radio at a reasonable volume from 9 to 11.

20
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:17,500
Yeah, no, no, I know you're allowed to. I was just thinking maybe like a, you know, personal favor.

21
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:24,500
Well, I told Bill that if Sandra's going to listen to her headphones while she's falling,

22
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,500
then I should be able to listen to the radio while I'm collating,

23
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,500
so I don't see why I should have to turn down the radio.

24
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,500
Yeah, all right, okay.

25
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,500
I enjoy listening at a reasonable volume from 9 to 11.

26
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,500
Hi, Peter. What's happening?

27
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,500
We need to talk about your TPS reports.

28
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,500
Yeah, the cover sheet, I know. I know. Bill talked to me about it.

29
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,500
Yeah. Did you get that memo?

30
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,500
Yeah, I got the memo, and I understand the policy,

31
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,500
and the problem is just that I forgot the one time,

32
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:57,500
and I've already taken care of it, so it's not even really a problem anymore.

33
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:03,500
Ah, yeah. It's just we're putting new cover sheets on all the TPS reports before they go out now,

34
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:08,500
so if you could go ahead and try to remember to do that from now on, that'd be great.

35
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,500
All right.
