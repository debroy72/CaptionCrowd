00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,400
My good friend, CGP Grey, has made a great video about the practical and philosophical

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,180
concerns with teleportation.

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:11,580
In particular, the concern that when a transporter dismantles the atoms in your body and reassembles

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,340
an identical arrangement of atoms somewhere else, perhaps the disassembled you actually

5
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:19,460
dies and the reassembled you is actually a new being that just thinks it's you.

6
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:23,380
And if they simply hadn't dismantled the original you, then there'd now be two yous

7
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:24,660
in the universe.

8
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,380
And which is really you?

9
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,700
You or the teleported you?

10
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,960
This video covers these questions really well, so if you want more background you should

11
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:32,960
go watch that.

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,880
But I do have one additional piece of information I'd like to point out.

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,300
Something the original creators of Star Trek were definitely unaware of because it was

14
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,940
discovered in the 1990s.

15
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,300
And that is quantum teleportation.

16
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:46,840
Quantum teleportation is the only kind of real teleportation technology we currently

17
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,620
have access to, and while I won't go into the details here, the point is you can take

18
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:54,380
some particles in a particular arrangement and transfer their exact quantum condition

19
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,700
onto other particles arbitrarily far away.

20
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:02,020
It kind of seems like sad teleportation because the particles don't move, just their state.

21
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:06,060
But isn't that essentially what a Star Trek teleporter does, albeit on a larger scale,

22
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,980
sending enough information and energy over to the new location to create the exact arrangement

23
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:13,180
or state of particles that corresponds to you?

24
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,980
And quantum teleportation has one pivotal property.

25
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:19,940
It is impossible to create an identical copy of a quantum state without destroying the

26
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:20,940
original.

27
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:24,680
In fact, you have to destroy the original arrangement in order to extract all the necessary information

28
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,280
from it to construct the new teleported state.

29
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,920
The relevant theorem in quantum mechanics is called the no-cloning theorem.

30
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:35,120
Now, we don't yet know exactly how brains work to create consciousness, but if the quantum

31
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,960
states of some electrons somewhere in the brain are critical to perfectly determining,

32
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,020
and thus copying, you, then a teleporter would necessarily have to obey the rules of quantum

33
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,360
teleportation when sending the information about the arrangement of particles that are

34
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,120
you to the new location.

35
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:52,240
So whatever was left behind would definitively not be you.

36
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,080
I've included links in the video description so that if you haven't already, you can go

37
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,080
and watch Grey's video.

38
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,080
It's really good.
