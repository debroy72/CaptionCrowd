00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
Today we're making this amazing one minute microwave cookie. This is not a

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,400
mug cookie, this is not a sad cookie. This is the proper delicious microwave

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:13,080
cookie. I really wanted to develop a recipe for you that was quick and

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,480
amazing. Once you try this you'll always be making one minute chocolate chip

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:22,400
cookie. Okay so we're gonna start out with some good old butter which we're

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,800
gonna melt in the microwave. To this we're gonna add some brown sugar and a

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,720
dash of milk which you'll see in a moment. I do not like to add eggs to any

8
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,760
of my microwave recipes. You know this eggs in the microwave usually become

9
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,000
rubbery and we don't like to eat rubber. Not on my channel okay? So we're gonna

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,360
substitute the eggs with a dash of milk. If you're new to my channel, hello there

00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,360
welcome. Make sure to subscribe and click that notification bell. I post new

12
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,240
videos every week. I've gone ahead and added the dry ingredients which are just

13
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:56,760
flour, baking soda and salt and you want to mix these just until combined. Now I'm

14
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,200
using chocolate chunks today. I've just cut up you know a chocolate bar. You can

15
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,900
use chocolate chips. Use whatever you like. You're going to fold these into the

16
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,960
dough and then you're gonna bring the dough together with your hands and shape

17
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,560
it into a cookie. So form a ball and press a depth. Place it onto some parchment

18
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,280
paper. Add more chocolate chips if you like and this is done. Well this is not

19
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,640
done you know you guys. Okay we're ready to microwave this. Now I'm gonna speed up

20
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,780
the video but I do want to mention two important things. You're going to cook

21
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,640
your cookie for exactly one minute. However every microwave is different so

22
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,280
just know that your cookie could take between one minute and one minute and

23
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,960
15 seconds. The second most important thing to know is to not overcook your

24
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,820
cookie. Your cookie should come out of the microwave still soft. As you can see

25
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:45,040
when you pick it up it's gonna be really soft. So let this cool for about five

26
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,720
minutes otherwise it's gonna be too hot to handle and the cookie will just fall

27
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,780
apart. How amazing does this look? You would think this was made in a regular

28
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,220
oven. If you love warm soft baked cookies you have to try this. This is

29
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:02,080
gooey, delicious and satisfying. Make this for late night craving after school,

30
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,200
after work. Have this with ice cream. You'll love it.
