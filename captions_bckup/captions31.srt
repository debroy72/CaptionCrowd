1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,480
When I was 13 years old, and about 5 foot 3, I had a coach tell me, you got a chance, kid.

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,480
You got a chance was all I needed.

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:16,120
About a few years later, I'm still playing ball.

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:20,320
When my team had weights at 6am, I'd go work on sprints at 5am.

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:27,320
And I'd tell myself while running in that parking structure, you got a chance, kid.

6
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,440
Every day I'd remind myself of those words.

7
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,240
You got a chance, kid.

8
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,480
And I'd think to myself, what if I can pull this off?

9
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,680
Or if I can get signed to play professional baseball?

10
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:46,840
If you want to play in college or pro ball, you're going to have to make sacrifices that

11
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,280
other people aren't willing to make.

12
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,680
You're going to have to get to bed earlier.

13
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,400
You're going to have to wake up earlier.

14
00:00:54,400 --> 00:01:00,000
It's going to feel like you're running and running with no sight of a finish line.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,160
You will become familiar with failure.

16
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,720
And you'll have many people who don't take you seriously after all less than 1% make

17
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,040
it, right?

18
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:17,000
Despite the odds, every single day you have to train and work as though you believe 100%

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,720
that it is going to happen.

20
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,920
You can't go half way.

21
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,520
You and I both know that won't work.

22
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,120
And maybe you're listening to this and thinking, I don't know if I have what it takes.

23
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,720
I'm weak.

24
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,960
And I can assure you I am weak too.

25
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,960
Listen to these words.

26
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,560
I listen to these words from Jaco Willink every single morning when I couldn't get myself

27
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,800
out of bed.

28
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,840
He says, do I have weakness?

29
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,760
I am nothing but weakness.

30
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,600
I'm not naturally fast or strong or flexible.

31
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,560
I procrastinate and I waste time.

32
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,480
I care too much about meaningless things and not enough about important things.

33
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:06,560
But all that being said, I don't accept that I am what I am and that that is what I am

34
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,560
doomed to be.

35
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,320
I'm fighting.

36
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,120
I'm always fighting.

37
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:20,120
I'm scraping and kicking and clawing those weaknesses to change them, to stop them.

38
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,280
And some days I win.

39
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,280
And some days I don't.

40
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:32,520
But each and every day I get back up and I move forward with my fists clenched towards

41
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,000
the battle, towards the struggle.

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,280
And I fight with everything I've got to overcome those weaknesses and those shortfalls as I

43
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:48,440
strive to be just a little bit better today than I was yesterday.

44
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,840
You see, it's not about minimizing how many times you fail.

45
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:57,080
It's about getting up quicker than everybody else.

46
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,400
You missed a day of lifting?

47
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,400
Get up.

48
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,600
You wasted time on your phone when you could have been getting better?

49
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,320
Get up.

50
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,440
Never stop getting up.

51
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,840
Never stop pushing.

52
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,840
You got a chance, kid.
