1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,800
The safety car is coming in at the end of this lap.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:07,500
We're going to have one lap of racing to decide the Championship.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,600
Hamilton has the advantage.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,400
Verstappen has the faster, fresher tires.

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:20,100
And we have got 3.2 miles of racing action all the way to the checkered flag.

6
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,600
As the crowd, roar the drivers on to the final lap of this race.

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,800
And Verstappen sets after Hamilton.

8
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:30,500
Is it going to be a first world championship for Verstappen

9
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,600
Is it going to be an eighth world championship for Lewis Hamilton?

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,400
Were can Verstappen try and get past Hamilton?

11
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,000
First overtaking zone is normally down to the turn five.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,700
Is Verstappen far enough back?

13
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,600
He's going to make the lunge down the inside.

14
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,000
Hamilton sees him coming.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,00
It's a late lunge by Verstappen who takes the led of the race for Verstappen.

16
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:55,200
Now slashes the championship trophy from Lewis Hamilton, who's trying to fight back.

17
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,600
No drs for two laps, so Lewis Hamilton will not get the rear wing open.

18
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,000
Now he's going to go down the outside.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,600
Verstappen keeps it tight and neat, but he hasn't.

20
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,000
He's got a little bit wide.

21
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,600
No biking, no, no biking.

22
0:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,200
That was so not right.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,800
Here comes Lewis Hamilton though, down the back straight.

24
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,000
He's got a slid stream.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,600
He almost touches Verstappen.

26
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,000
They almost make contact into turn nine.

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Verstappen stays ahead of Lewis Hamilton of all the drama, of all the controvrsy,

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,800
of all the magic moments in Formula One in 2021.

29
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:37,500
It comes down to this and at this moment, it looks like it's going to go the way of Max Verstappen.

30
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,500
Mercedes not happy.

31
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,500
Red Bull will be delighted.

32
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:47,900
They have shared a briliant championship battle, but the championship can only be one by one.

33
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,100
And it's going Dutch in 2021.

34
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:56,600
max Verstappen for the first time ever is champion of the world.
