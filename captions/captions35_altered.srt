1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,400
Playoff time, baby.

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:02,700
Games, snacks, drink.

3
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,40
I mean, what else can you ask for, bro?

4
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:04,840
Really?

5
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:05,640
Hey, pass me a pepsi.

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,180
I mean, can you drink any louder?

7
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,180
Thats how I drink.

8
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,080
Loud like that?

9
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:14,680
I drink loud.

10
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:15,640
I like to enjoy it.

11
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,640
Tos me some ways.

12
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,520
Did you eat any louder?

13
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,620
It's normal to eat loud.

14
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,120
Drinking loud makes no sense.

15
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,120
BAM!

16
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,120
BAM!

17
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,120
Hayden!

18
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,120
Eli!

19
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,120
Road trip!

20
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,120
Hard pass.

21
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,120
Playoff are on.

22
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,120
You're paying for that door, by the way.

23
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,120
I got a bus!

24
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,120
The bus has got a bus!

25
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,120
Let's go!

26
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,120
Can we go see the bus?

27
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,120
What up, Eli?

28
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,120
Mr Cruz!

29
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,120
I miss you, buddy.

30
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,120
I miss you too, man.

31
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,120
Super Bowl, baby.

32
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,120
Let's go!

33
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,120
We're not going.

34
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,120
I'm going to get more chips and drinks.

35
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,120
Do not live this room.

36
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,120
I got you.

37
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,120
I got you.

38
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,120
Whoa!

39
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,120
Super Bowl!

40
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,120
Here we go!

41
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,120
Are you kidding me?

42
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,120
Technically, I didnt leave the room.

43
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,120
I'll call her mom.

44
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,120
After I finish these chips.

45
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,120
How much longer?

46
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,120
You drive weird.

47
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,120
Bus, are we their yet?

48
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,120
No!

49
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,120
Hey, bus, we got to pull over for some more chips and drinks.

50
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,120
Oh, you got it.

51
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,120
Hey, guys, look who I found.

52
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,120
Bradshaw?

53
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,120
Hey, guys, got room for one more?

54
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,120
Got Doritos?

55
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,120
Got mountain Dew.

56
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,120
Do we really want to bring them?

57
00:01:22,20 --> 00:01:23,120
They might start to feel crowded.

58
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,120
I mean, maybe if you had a little...

59
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,120
Oh, plz don't.

60
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,120
Don't say it.

61
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,120
Salsa.

62
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,120
I love me some salza.

63
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,120
All right, I got an idea.

64
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:36,120
We got one seat left, and it's special just for you.

65
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,120
Lets do it!

66
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,120
Ahhh!

67
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,120
It's like a convertible.

68
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,120
It's a hole lot better.

69
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:00,120
I lost my mind like something my way.

70
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,120
It's all my fault.

71
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,120
Just so Im naked, I really don't get it.

72
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,120
It does kind of open things up a little bit.
