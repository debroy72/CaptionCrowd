1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,080
You who their goes Mr. Deer.

2
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,120
Oh and there's Mr. Crow.

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,920
Hey Mr. Deer, how do you do?

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,200
Im good.

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,600
What about you?

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,600
hey there, meet Mr. Deer and Mr. Crow.

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,720
No, don't get confused.

8
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,520
They are nothing but the shadow of my hands.

9
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,120
Come, let me tell you more about shadow.

10
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,320
Zoom in!

11
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,720
Shadow is nothing but the light that cannot pass throug an object.

12
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:47,440
But hey, you can only see shadows of objects that are visible to eyes.

13
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:54,320
For example, a tree will have a shadow, so Will you and I.

14
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:00,520
But not air and water, because light can pass through them.

15
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,200
U can have multiple shadows.

16
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,960
It all depends on the number of light sources.

17
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,880
The more the number of lights, the more shadows you will have.

18
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,200
Oh, there goes Mr. Deer again.

19
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,000
Hey, you got to see how Mr. Deer changes in size.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,040
There's a reeson behind it.

21
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:29,160
When I move the lights away from my hand, the shadow becomes smaller in size.

22
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:35,400
And when I bring the light source near, the shadow becomes large.

23
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:41,200
When you putt the light source just over the object, you get the shortest shadow.

24
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,120
Whoa, Mr. Deer looks so small now.

25
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:51,200
Hmmm, now you know that the size of a shadow depends on the distance

26
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,480
between the light source and the object.

27
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:00,480
Its hard for many to believe that light travels in a straight line.

28
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,040
Yes, it's true.

29
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:08,600
Light cannot bend or turn around that object to light up the area behind it.

30
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,720
trivia time!

31
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:17,600
When there were no clocks, people used to estimate time using the sun clock.

32
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:25,920
A shadow cast by the Earth on the moon results in a lunar eclips, the source of light being the sun.

33
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,840
So this is me Zooming out.

34
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,680
Tune in next time for more fun facts.
