00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
It's a great big world.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We're so much to learn.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We're pasionately geographic kids.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Hey everyone, it's Kai again.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Im back with another amazing episode of Nat Geo Kids.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And this week were talking all about robots.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Okay, so I bet you're wondering, what exactly is a robot?

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Good question.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Basically, a robot is a machine created to perform a series of actions.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
These actions could be as simple as roaming around the house vaccuuming up dirty floors.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:42,000
While other robots perform more complicated tasks such as traveling to and exploring different planets like Nasa's Mars Exploration Robots,

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
which were built to study the surface of Mars.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And did you know that humans have been building robots for centuries?

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:57,000
In fact, many believed the first robot was created over 2000 years ago in ancient Greece by a man named Architea.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Architea built a bird like self-repelling machine that could fly up to a distance of 200 meters.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
That's like too football fields.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Today, robots come in all shapes and sizes.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Some are small, even microscopic, while others are large.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
In some cases, as big as a car or even a trunk.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
They are flying robots, robots can drive, and robots that can swim.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Robots can do a lot of things.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Who knows

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Maybe one day robots will be able to do just about everything that humans can do.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Scientists think so.

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
To get us started, lets take a look at this first set of videos where we learn a little bit more about robots.
