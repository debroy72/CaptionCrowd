1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
ESports is the massive world around video games.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
E-Sports started at UCI with our gaming club and it's been our dream for many, many years to create an E-Sports program.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The UCI E-Sports program is based on four pillars. First, compitetion,

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
second, academics and research, community and entertainment.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Part of our program is oviously the extremely big scholarship piece.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We've been recruiting from some of the top players in the nation.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We were able to successfully recruit five to six of the best League of Legends

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
players that we could find that were also really good student.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We're creating a brand new program so with it comes a ton of opportunity,

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
your going to all have a huge influence on this, right?

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Besides the fact that it's a really prestigious school to be able to attend in the first place, 

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I've been looking for an avenue to further my life after commiting so much time into just playing League of Legends competitively.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
We are going to have a beautiful new 3500 sq foot E-Sports arena.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Here we go.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It's been a long road to get to the point where we're actually getting things delivered to the arena. We are very excited to launch these program.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,000
One, two, three, Zot Zot Zot!

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And E-Sports is open!

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Our goal is to unite the gaming community in Southern california and be the best place for high level play in video games.

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
There is no ceiling to how big and succesful this program can be.
