1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,520
This is luminol.

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:07,280
It's a chemical that exhibits something called chemiluminiscence and when it reacts, it can

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,800
release light.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,320
To make these happen, I just have to add water to a beaker and a decent amount of sodium

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,520
carbonate.

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:21,840
Then I can add the luminol, which can disolve in this solution.

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,320
I also need to add some sodium bicarbonate and this solution is basically ready.

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,440
Now I just need to make an iron solution by mixing together 3% hydrogen peroxide and

9
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,880
something called potassium fericyanide.

10
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,880
To make the luminol glow, I just have to mix these two solution together.
