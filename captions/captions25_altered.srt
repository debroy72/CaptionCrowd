1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Sunny!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Yes?

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Nothing would thrill me more greatly than to shoot you.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Knocking off a youngstar ain't gonna mean all that much to me, understand?

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
But since were in a hurry, I'll make a deal with you.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
You throw down your camera and we won't hurt you.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
You'll never hear form us again, okay?

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You promise?

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I cross my heart and hope to die.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Okay!

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Okay, kid. Give it to me.

12
0:00:50,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Direct him!

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
How many finger am I holding up, Marv?

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Okay, kid. You wanna throw bricks?

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Go ahead, throw anather one.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
If you can't do any better than that, kid, you're gonna lose.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Mary.

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You got any more?

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Come on, Marv. Get up. You don't have any more brick.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
He's out of them.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
What?

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
What?

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Have you came back yet?

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
What? Have you came back yet?

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Have you came back yet

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I did it! Nobody choose bricks.

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Nobody chose bricks at me and gets away with it.

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Come on, Marv. Get up.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You go this way. Im going around the back.

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Harry?

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Harry?

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Hary?
