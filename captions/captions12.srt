1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Get ready for things you want to know.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
You probably know Simba from the Lion King movie.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
But did you know that Simba means lion in Swahili?

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
And crowned king of the jungle because of its power and presence.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Found mostly in Sub-Saharan Africa,

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
lions have a special sense of family

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and are the only big cats that prefer to live in groups called a pride.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
A family unit with up to three males,

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
a dozen females and their young, often all related,

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
with as many as 15 lions.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The lionesses certainly have their paws full as the primary hunters of their pride.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
These queens and princesses like to stick together to help make their royal pride strong.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Using stealth and strategy,

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
female lions often work together to bring down prey.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And while the queens are out hunting for food,

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
the kings of the jungle are likely taking their long daily nap.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Male lions spend about 18 to 20 hours a day sleeping.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
When they're not sleeping,

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
they're protecting their pride and their territory,

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
using their powerful roar that they don't gain until two years of age.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Lions are 25 times louder than a gas-powered lawnmower.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Both the kings and queens of the jungle play an important role

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
in keeping their royal family healthy and safe.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So Simba, his lionesses and the rest of the pride

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
definitely cause an uproar in the wild.
