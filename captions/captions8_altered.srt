1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
watch carefully.

2
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,400
Look at that.

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:13,400
Oh boy.

4
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,200
F***ing delicious.

5
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:23,300
Oh my lord.

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,300
I decided to teach a second masterclass.

7
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,300
This, this, dis, this.

8
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,100
Oh boy.

9
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:35,300
this time round, I'm going to take you into an area were you felt your home cooking could never go.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,300
The secret behind any great soufle is in the buttering of the mold.

11
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,800
You brush vertical stroke up.

12
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,000
This crispy chicken salad for me is the get out of jail card,

13
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:55,200
especially when you've got a big dinner party because that is good enough for four or five of you.

14
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,700
Grab a leaf, lift it up.

15
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,800
Now, I'm fed up when you see chefs oiling asparagus.

16
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:04,800
Beautiful.

17
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,300
You get a frei facial at the same time.

18
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,300
Cooking is a labour of love.

19
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,700
Stay close to every step of the way.

20
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:19,800
I'm going to teach you methods, secrets that I'm teaching some of the best chefs in the world today.

21
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,300
Im Gordern Ramsay and this is my masterclass.

22
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,800
You
