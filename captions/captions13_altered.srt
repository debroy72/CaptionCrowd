00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So I've been geting a lot of comments asking to compare electrical engineering

2
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:11,800
to something else like electrical and electronics engineering or electrical and communications engineering or I don't know, EE versus ECE.

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,800
And the reality is none of these things mean anything. these are all probably like

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:19,280
marketing gimmicks by universities to show that they can offer multiple majors

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,280
when in reality there's only one major and that is electrical engineering.

6
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,650
Electronics is a branch of electrical engineering. Same with communication.

7
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:31,640
It's a branch of electrical engineering. Electrical engineering is based on electromagnetic physics. Its based on the physics of charges.

8
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:43,440
It's based on the idea that if you have a charge, charge exerts an electric field.

9
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,040
And if I take that charge and I move it, that exerts a magnetic feild.

10
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:43,440
And if I keep moving it back and forth, changing magnetic field exerts an electric field back once again.

11
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,320
And this is literally electrical engineering. It's based on this electromagnetic physics.

12
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,040
Now, if you don't believe me, I would strongly urge you to check your university's curriculum and

13
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,040
you will see that most of the courses are the exactly the same.

14
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,000
You'll still have to take calculus. You'll still have to take tons of physics.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,400
You'll still have to take some type of electronics classes where you learn about circuits.

16
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,240
Your still going to have to take Signals and Systems and learn about signal processing.

17
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,040
And sure, maybe like an electronics engineering degree,

18
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:11,640
you will be a lot more focused on like circuit design and breadboard design and things like that and PCBs.

19
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,480
While like a purely electrical engineering degree might include other option or

20
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:21,480
like a communication or telecommunications degree will focus on signal processing and will focus on electromagnetic waves.

21
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:25,000
But there's only one physics and that physics is electromagnetic physics.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,760
It's the physics based on electric fields, magnetic fields and electromagnetic waves. And thats it.

23
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:35,320
If you understand charges, electric fields, magnetic fields, electromagnetic wave,

24
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:41,320
if you understand those things, that is the foundation of any electrical electronics, telecommunications major or anything like that.

25
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:48,240
So as always in my vedios, I urge you to learn the fundamentals and get back to the basics and really focus on getting the basics really well.

26
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,520
Because if you understand the fundamentals, if you understand electromagnetic physics and

27
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,240
you go out in the real world and there's all these people throwing these fancy terms that you you're not

28
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:01,520
really fazed by it because you have a very solid understanding of the ground that everything else is built on top of.

29
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:07,640
I will say that one important distinction and major difference is electrical engineering vs electrical engineering technology.

30
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:13,920
Thats because the electrical engineering technology has a bit more focus on application less on the electromagnetic physics theory.

31
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,040
And I actually made a video about that so you can check it out over here.
