00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
Now the secret behind any great burger of course is in the colour making sure you've

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:15,000
got a nice beautiful colour on that burger patty. Get that pan nice and warm. In we go.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:26,040
Again season it. Salt and pepper. As that starts caramelising a little touch of butter in there

4
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:32,520
just add more and more flavour. Start off at medium high heat. Turn it down and use the

5
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,720
remaining heat in that pan to continue cooking that burger beautifully. You can see that the

6
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:44,040
actual patty is starting to caramelise. You only flip burgers once, okay. Have the confidence

7
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,680
use the pan. Let the pan do the work and get that beautiful colour in there. I'm just going

8
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:55,760
to give that a little baste there. You can see what's happening up and over. Look at that colour.

9
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:02,960
Touch more butter. And because I've got all that beautiful heat in the pan, look, you can get my

10
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:09,920
onions in there and beautifully caramelise these onions. Season the other side of the burgers.

11
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:16,800
Season the onions. Again fresh cracked pepper. And now this whole thing is starting to come

12
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:24,840
together. Turn over my onions. Beautiful. The flavour and the smell is incredible. We're

13
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,880
literally cooking the burger two minutes each side. I like my burgers just under medium.

14
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:39,720
Before I put my cheese on, I like to season the burger again. Cheese on. Season the cheese.

15
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:50,560
And again, one more on top. And then from there, touch of fresh pepper. How do we melt that cheese

16
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:58,320
properly? First of all, turn off the heat. Get your lid. Stick that on top. And that will help

17
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:04,000
melt that cheese beautifully. Set that to the side. And now for the exciting part. This is where

18
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
we start to build this beautiful burger. My buns are being toasted, okay. So that's going to give

19
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,160
me a little bit more crispiness on there as well. First of all, a little smear of mayonnaise.

20
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:22,160
Soft butter lettuce. Just don't slice it. Just crack that open. Let that sit nicely. Again,

21
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:28,400
layer it up. Touch of salt. Touch of pepper. It goes a long way. Tomato on. And again,

22
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:34,880
a little touch of mustard. A beautiful Dijon mustard. And just rub that on the top part of

23
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:42,080
my bun. And then from there, I need some acid. I've got my pickles now. We're ready. Lid off.

24
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:48,320
Look at that cheese. It's melted beautifully. You can still hear that cook taking place inside

25
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:57,160
the pan. That's going to sit on top. And then finally, these onions, look at them. Caramelized,

26
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:06,840
beautifully. I just love the flavor. I just like to hit that with a touch of fresh pepper. And then,

27
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:12,480
bang. Now come on. That is a burger to die for.
