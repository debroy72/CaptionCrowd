00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,080
The Digital Twins really one of the up and coming themes in visualisation where we're

2
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:16,680
looking at a connected data source, so that could be a plant, it could be a process, it

3
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,880
could be a product, feeding into a virtual model.

4
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:25,000
I think there are two levels of understanding at the moment. Some of the Catapult centres

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,640
have been for some time working with leading businesses. They are effectively working with

6
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:35,520
automation systems. They have a high level of understanding. The other level of understanding

7
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,920
is a more generic awareness and that's where a lot of the questions are coming from. People

8
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,320
are asking how can I get a Digital Twin and what's it going to do for us in terms of business

9
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,320
impact.

10
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,280
So one of the biggest challenges of the Digital Twin is the vast number of different source

11
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,480
models and 3D models that are out there. So there isn't a seamless transition from a

12
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:01,320
complex 3D model into a real time interactive package. The model has to be modified, edited

13
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,240
and optimised for the application. So different workflows need to be developed and adopted

14
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,800
by designers so that they build the 3D content in an optimised format that hopefully can

15
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:16,680
still be used for their core applications but then enables Digital Twins and other applications

16
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,520
to feed off that.

17
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:23,040
I think the biggest part of the challenge is how you get human engagement, how you get

18
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:28,440
operators to work with this new technology. It's sort of human nature to be resistant

19
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:33,640
to change but if we don't change you'll find there are similar companies that are prepared

20
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:38,920
to embrace those changes and become more productive. So the point being is we need to embrace change

21
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,360
but you have to do it in a very careful way. I think it's going to be an evolution rather

22
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,200
than a revolution.

23
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,880
The technology is no longer the barrier. We can do things now that five years ago we'd

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,880
have dreamt of. The barrier is now around the adoption of it. Because of that we actually

25
00:01:53,880 --> 00:02:00,120
need to drive this community to develop and publish and publicise more use cases where

26
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,560
there is clear return on investment and it's only by that that we can really accelerate

27
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,840
the adoption of these technologies and extract greater value from them.
