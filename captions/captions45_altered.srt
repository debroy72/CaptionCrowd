00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,920
Industry 4.0 or the fourth industrial revolution is transforming the way we manufacture goods

2
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,360
and interact with our built and natural environment.

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,160
3D printing is a great example that is being trialled in some very unexpected places.

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,160
Take Australias Great Barrier Reef where work is underway to 3D print artificial reefs

5
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,680
in response to deteriorating corel ecosystems.

6
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:33,720
This kind of innovation is also being explored on the farm using blockchain technology.

7
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:39,000
Form paddock to plate, blockchain is making the food supply chain faster, safer and more

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,400
secure.

9
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:45,200
Driverless cars were unthought of just a few years ago, industry 4.0 is making them

10
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,200
real.

11
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,520
Better traffic flow, safety, productivity and less environmental impact were all a part

12
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,920
of this incredible work.

13
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,000
The fourth industrial revolution is well and truly underway.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,280
It's standard to driving this inovation and making the impossible possible.
