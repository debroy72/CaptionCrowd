1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
Now this is very interesting.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,160
You get to see the sunrise before the sun actually rises.

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,840
You know what happens?

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:17,320
Earth's atmosphere has different layers and also the optical densities of these layers

5
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:23,880
decreases as you move away from the earth's surface that is with increasing height.

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:32,560
So what happens is just before sunrise, before the sun reaches the horizon, the sunlight

7
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:36,440
enters obliquely into the atmosphere.

8
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,240
It gets refracted through the atmospheric layers.

9
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:46,440
Now this refraction causes the light rays to bend so the sunlight actually reaches the

10
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,560
earth's surface in a curved path.

11
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,880
What happens from the point of view of an observer?

12
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:01,280
Following the path of the light rays entering the eyes, the observer actually sees the sun

13
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,000
slightly above its actual position.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,120
And as a result of that, he sees the sun about two minutes before the sun actually rises.
