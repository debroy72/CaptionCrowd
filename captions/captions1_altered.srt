1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,680
You wanted more microwave recipe.

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,920
So today we're making this amazing brownie

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,960
in one minute in the microwave.

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,600
These is fudgy, delicious,

5
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,000
and everything you want in a brownie.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,400
Have this bye itself or with ice cream.

7
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,740
It makes the perfect late night treat.

8
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,720
So we're gonna start out with some butter and chocolate,

9
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,120
which we're gonna melt in the microwave.

10
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,120
You do want to cut the chocolate in small chunks.

11
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,400
Otherwise whats gonna happen

12
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,140
is the butter will start to fry the microwave

13
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,120
before the chocolate gets a chance to melt.

14
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,760
So just remember, big peace of butter,

15
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,320
small chunks of chocolate.

16
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,560
This didn't take long at all.

17
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,320
I want to say this probably took 30 seconds

18
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,280
in the microwave, so just keep an eye on it.

19
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,840
Give it a good mix and add the sugar.

20
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,020

22
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,480
I post new videos every week.

23
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,200
I've gone ahead and aded the milk

24
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,640
and the flour and salt.

25
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,680
I absolutely love this recipe.

26
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,480
It comes together in a snap and its delicious.

27
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,200
You can serve this warm or cool.

28
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,200
It's delicious either way.

29
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,840
Now I'm gonna use this smal microwaveable container.

30
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,760
You do not need a sqaure container.

31
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,200
You can use just any microwave safe bowl

32
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,080
or even a wide mug.

33
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,320
I will however, right in the description box

34
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,840
the exact measurements of the container I used

35
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,800
because the timing will vary if you use a smaller

36
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,400
or bigger container than the one I used.

37
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,800
Make sure you line the container with some parchmant paper

38
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,800
all the way up the sides.

39
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,160
That way it's easier to transfer the brownie

40
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,280
out of the container once its done.

41
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,240
Add some chocolate.

42
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,120
This is optional but recommended

43
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,280
because microwave brownies don't usually get

44
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,160
that crackly top that you would get in a traditional oven.

45
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,400
So adding the chocolate on top besides being delicious

46
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,560
will give you a similar effect.

47
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,160
You're going to microwave your brownie

48
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,800
anywhere between one minute to one minute and 15 seconds.

49
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,400
Mien took exactly one minute and 15 seconds.

50
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,360
Do not over bake your brownie.

51
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,920
Now you can have this as is rite away.

52
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,640
However, if you do choose to eat this right away

53
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,560
you're going to have to serve this on a plate

54
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,960
because it's too hot, you know, it will just fall apart.

55
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,760
So serve it with ice cream, delicious,

56
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,240
maybe some chocolate sauce and with a spoon.

57
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,200
However, if you do have the patient to wait 15 minutes

58
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,840
you will be able to pick this up as a regular browni

59
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,440
and eat it with your hands.

60
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,760
As it cools, it will also get that signature

61
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,040
died brownie texture.

62
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,520
Whichever way you serve it, it's delicious.

63
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,080
I am going to trim the edges just so I can get a thumbnail.

64
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,640
You do not need to cut the sides

65
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,000
and yes, those were eaten as well.

66
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,120
I feel like I alway have to specify this

67
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,720
because there's always that one person

68
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,680
that's very concerned about what happens to the edges.

69
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,960
This is absolutely amazing.

70
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,640
It's decadent, fudgy and chocolatey.

71
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,080
The texture is that of a fudgy brownie.

72
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,840
It's dense in a good way.

73
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,600
It's riche and this will melt in your mouth.
