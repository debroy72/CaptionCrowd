Here is cloud computing in 60 seconds.

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:15,600
Cloud computing refers to computing services such as data storage or computing power or programs

3
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:22,080
that are provided on demand and is delivered as a service over the internet.

4
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,720
Think of Apple's iCloud that you use to back up and store your phone data

5
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:33,440
and the way we now use Microsofts Office tools via their 365 cloud platform

6
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,360
or how we store our documents on google Docs.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,880
Instead of buying or owning the technology, it is usually provided via a subscription service.

8
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:52,240
That means you usually pay for what you use and where the IT infrastructure used to provide

9
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:56,080
the service is managed by the provider and not by the users.

10
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,480
Cloud computing is now used by individuals and companies of all sizes as a very convenient and

11
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,440
flexible way to acess computing services.
