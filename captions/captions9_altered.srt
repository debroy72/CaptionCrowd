Do you want to be buzing like the bees?

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:06,120
Well, you're in the right place because today I'm going to show you how to make honey wine at home a.k.a.

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:11,300
mead and just the time of the time that traditional mead making takes all thanks to Bruzy. So meat is a honey wine

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:15,320
It's gluten-free delicious and good for the bees. The Vikings used to drink it too

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:21,160
So that's kind of cool gets your biking on. It's pretty simple to make all you need is your gallon jug honey water and your

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,160
Bruzy bag. I started off by heating up two-thirds of the gallon of water and adding my honey

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,520
You are what you drink so Im gonna make a sweet me

8
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,600
I added three cups of honey into my water and let it dissolve

9
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,360
Then you let the mixture cool until it reaches room temperature

10
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,720
These stuff is really important because we don't want to kill the yeast with too hot of water

11
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:43,720
Now all that's left to do is add your Bruzy bag shake well and keep it in a warm and dark place for seven days to ferment

12
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:47,400
So well be back in one week with an update. Stay tuned. Cheers
