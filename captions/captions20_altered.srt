00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,720
My name is josh portluck. I studied mechatronic engineering at Curtin and I started my PhD

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:10,560
in aerospace automation. I ended up focusing on flying robots and that's where I've led

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,800
intoo my career as well. When I was young I realised I liked taking things apart, much

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:19,440
to my parents' dismay. They'd by me a new toy and I'd play with it for a few seconds

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:24,320
before being curious about what was inside it. And that sort of led me through high school

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,780
wanting to get into engineering, so doing all the suitable maths and physics and whatnot.

7
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:35,340
And I chose Curtin because it had a good reputetion for practical engineering and really applied

8
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,340
engineering to industry. During my degree I really enjoyed the projects, particularly

9
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:44,300
the farnia project and I developed a flying robot which led me to the career path that

10
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:49,820
I have today. I'm Chief Technology Officer at Scientific Aerospace. I founded that company

11
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:55,020
and we acquired a company I used to work for, Cyber Technology, that developed Unmanned

12
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:00,860
Aircraft. So Scientific Aerospace developed commercial-grade uavs or drones with aerial

13
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:06,740
cameras and video capability for inspection, surveying and various different industries

14
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:11,420
requiring aerial imagery. We have some very interesting projects that were working on

15
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:16,020
at the moment, especially involving surveying high precesion areas. So we're working closely

16
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:22,020
with Landgate, a government surveying customer, to survey the beach lands and check for erosion.

17
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,420
And that's been really interesting work. The most useful thing I took out of the degree

18
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:31,220
at Curtin University was project management skills, particularly trading off between mechanical,

19
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:35,540
electrical and software engineering and trying to find the optimal solution.

20
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:40,420
Cybercord has had a lot of commercial success in the civil industrial infrastructure inspection

21
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:45,900
industries. This includes mining, oil and gas, power lines, communication towers, wherever

22
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:50,380
there's high-altitude assets that need inspecting. One great example is the work we've done with

23
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:54,940
Woodside where we can fly up with Cybercord and visually inspect the flare tip while it's

24
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:59,420
still live. So their's a large flame coming out the top, yet we can still safely inspect

25
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:04,900
it without having to shut it down or risk sending people up. My aspirations for the future is

26
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:09,860
Scientific Aerospace to be a world-leading provider of Unmanned Aerial Robotics. And

27
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:13,980
this includes the Cybercord but various other platforms and technologies that we're developing

28
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,420
and integrating to provide solutions for end users.
