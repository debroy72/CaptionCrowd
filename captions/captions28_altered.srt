1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
Oh, Im going pro.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,240
Oh, okay.

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,300
Yeah, I dont know.

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,280
You know, you'll probobly be about as good as I was.

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,680
That's kind of the way it works, you know,

6
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,580
and I was below average.

7
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,240
Yeah, so, whoa.

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,480
So you'll probably ultimately rank

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,520
somewhere around their, you know, so...

10
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,280
Really, you'll xcel at a lot of things, just not this.

11
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,760
I don't want you out here shooting this ball

12
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,920
around all day and night all right?

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:31,840
Okay.

14
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,580
hi, good.

15
00:00:35,580 --> 00:01:01,640
Don't ever let somebody tell you.

16
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:06,640
Don't ever let somebody tell you you cant do something.

17
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,640
Not even me.

18
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,640
All right?

19
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,640
All right?

20
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,640
You got a dream.

21
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,640
You got to protect it.

22
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,640
People can't do something themselves.

23
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,640
They want to tell you you can't do it.

24
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,640
People can't do something themselve.

25
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,640
They want to tell you you can't do it.

26
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,640
You want something? Go get it.

27
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,640
Period.

28
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,640
Let's go.

29
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,640
Don't ever let somebody tell you you can't do it.
