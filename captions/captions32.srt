1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The goal of baseball is to score more runs than the other team.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game wins.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
To score a run, first try to hit the ball with a baseball bat when the pitcher throws it to you.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
If you miss the ball, you get a strike, and once you get three strikes, you're out.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
When you hit the ball, run counterclockwise around the three bases, and back to the home plate you started at.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
If you make it back without getting out, you score a run for your team.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:38,000
If you can't make it all the way back, you can stop at first, second, or third base, and wait for the next player on your team to bat.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Then, if they hit the ball, you can continue running along the bases, toward the home plate.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Keep in mind that the other team will be trying to get you out while you're running the bases.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
There are three ways they can do that.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
First, if the other team picks up the ball and beats you to your base with it, you're out.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Second, if a player on the other team is holding the ball and they tag you with it, that means you're out.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Finally, if you hit the ball and the opposing team catches it in the air, you're out.

14
00:01:07,00 --> 00:01:15,000
Once your team has three outs, move to the outfield and try to stop the other team from scoring runs by getting them out.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
After each team has gone up to bat, that's the end of the first inning.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
In the official rules, there are nine innings in a baseball game.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Since there are no ties in baseball, keep playing additional innings if necessary until one team wins.
