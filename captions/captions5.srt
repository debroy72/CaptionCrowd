1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
Oh no. What?

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,100
I've got to leave for a date in two minutes.

3
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:05,500
What's the problem then?

4
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,800
Well I really want to have some two minute noodles.

5
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,700
Gee that is a slim time frame.

6
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,300
I'm not going to be able to cook two minute noodles,

7
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,000
which takes two minutes,

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,200
and then eat them,

9
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,300
which takes another one minute.

10
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,300
Fear not, I have the solution.

11
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,100
What is it?

12
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,800
I've been hiding a secret brother.

13
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,600
You've been hiding a secret brother?

14
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,200
No.

15
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,000
Where is he?

16
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,900
No, I've been-

17
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,600
Arnold!

18
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,700
Arnold!

19
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:31,500
No, I've been hiding a secret brother.

20
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,000
Who the f*** is Arnold?

21
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,300
Well what's the secret?

22
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:38,500
I can make two minute noodles in one minute.

23
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,100
What?

24
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,200
Where'd you come from?

25
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,200
The audacity of that statement conjured me out of thin air.

26
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,900
Wait, wait, so let me get this straight.

27
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:49,400
You reckon you can make two minute noodles in one minute?

28
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,100
Yes.

29
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,300
Well now you're just speaking gobbledygook.

30
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,100
I have magic abilities.

31
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,400
Magic abilities?

32
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,400
That's not real.

33
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,000
Darcy, you just appeared out of thin air.

34
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,600
Are you saying you're a wizard?

35
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,300
I'm just saying that there's a special spell.

36
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,200
Get on to it, we're running out of time.

37
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,500
Blitz and Blanton make this water hot as f***.

38
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,600
Wow, that was instant.

39
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,300
I can probably make my date now.

40
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:18,900
We did it.

41
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:19,700
We did it!

42
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,300
How long have you guys been talking?

43
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,000
Oh, at least a minute and a half.

44
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,500
You'd almost be further along the two minute noodle journey

45
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,500
if you just did it without all this magic.

46
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,000
Wimmy-d-d-blammy-d, shut the f*** up, Eddie.

47
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,700
Magic doesn't work on me.

48
0:01:31,700 --> 00:01:32,300
What?

49
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,900
Guys, this video is supposed to be about noodles.

50
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,800
Why does magic not work on you, Darcy?

51
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:41,400
Because as magic law states, you can't use magic on your own brother.

52
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,200
Arnold!

53
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,700
It is I, Arnold.

54
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:46,000
Guys, we've completely lost the noodle plot line.

55
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,300
This is the secret brother you've been hiding.

56
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,300
This video is supposed to be about noodles.

57
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,200
I can't believe it, Arnold, you're home.
