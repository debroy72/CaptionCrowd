00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,800
In a single minute your body produces 120 to
180 million red blood cells, people ask Google 2.4
million questions,

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:09,000
and 25 million Coca-Cola products are consumed.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,200
Many of those bottles will end up in
a landfill where the World Bank estimates we produce
5 million pounds of garbage.

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,200
108 human lives will be lost in this minute
and an adult male will lose 96 million cells.

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,700
Fortunately, 96 million cells divide replacing those lost.

6
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:23,700
Speaking of divisions, in the USA, 1.5 people
get divorced while worldwide, 116 people will
get married,

7
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,300
83,300 people have sex but only 258 babies will
be born,

8
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,500
and a fetus is developing neurons at a rate
of 250,000 per minute.

9
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,500
So it's no wonder that a computer simulation
takes 60 quagdrillion bytes to simulate a minute.

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,300
An average of 1.38 micrometers of rain fall around
the world, which is 4.7 billion bathtubs of water
every minute,

11
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,000
and with the storms comes approximately 6,000 bolts
of cloud to ground lightning hitting the Earth.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,700
A 150 pound person expends 1.1 calories of energy per
minute while sleeping, while the sun provides it with
83.33 terawatts of energy.

13
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:54,700
The Earth will complete 1,800 kilometers of its
940 million around the sun, moving 1,034 times
faster than a cheetah.

14
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:59,100
70,000 hours of Netflix are watched, 300 hours
are uploaded to YouTbe, and you can watch this
