00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
Many young players and parents often git confused with the ofside role in soccer.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,160
Here's a simple explanation under to minutes.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,960
There are some basis rules to understand first.

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,160
Only the team with posession of the ball can be offside.

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,480
So a defending team canot be called offside.

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,080
And offside can only occur on the attacking side of the field.

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,760
So let's illustrate this.

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,520
The red team has possession of the ball here, and they are attacking from left to right.

9
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,840
This side of the field is their defending halv.

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,200
No player from the red team can be called offside on this side of the line.

11
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:33,040
She or he can only be called offside on this attacking side of the field.

12
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,520
So what is offside then?

13
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,360
Technically speaking, a player is in an offside position

14
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,480
when an attacking player is nearer to the opponent's goal line

15
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,040
than both the boll and the second to last opponent.

16
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,520
So in this case, as the red team is on attack,

17
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,800
the goalkeeper is the first opponent and this defender is the second.

18
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,520
A real simple way to look at it is to draw an imaginary line across the field at the last

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,200
defender and any player beyond that line is offside.

20
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,600
This player is offside, this player is not.

21
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,880
Now just being in an offside position is not an infraction.

22
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,600
However, it is an infraction when the attacking player is in an offside position

23
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,680
and is actively involved in a play.

24
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,120
So if the ball is played to him now, the refere stops play

25
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,240
and awards a free kick to the defending team for the position of the foul.

26
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,160
There's one additional scenario of an offside infraction.

27
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,840
If the ball gets behind the defender, the ball becomes the offside line

28
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,240
and cannot be played forward to an attacking teammate.

29
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,480
You must stay behind the ball.

30
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,400
Finally, there are there exceptions when offside is not called.

31
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,080
On a goal kick, a throw in, and a corner kick.

32
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,800
I hope this claryfied what the offside rule is in soccer.

33
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,640
Have fun and thanks for watching.
