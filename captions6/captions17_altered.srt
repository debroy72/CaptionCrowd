00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,440
From the outside, you can't tell what is inside a black hole.

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:15,760
You can throw televsion sets, diamond rings, or even your worst enemies into a black hole,

3
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:21,360
and all the black whole will remember is the total mass and the singular momentum and electric

4
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,880
charge.

5
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:28,560
Quantum mechanics implies that the whole of space is filled with pairs of virtual particles

6
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:35,200
and antiparticles that are constantly materializing in pairs, and then comming together again

7
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,320
and anihilating each other.

8
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,520
One member of a pair of virtual particles may fall into the hole, leaving the other

9
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,000
member without a partner with which to annihilate.

10
0:00:46.000 --> 0:00:52.560
The foresaken particle or antiparticle may fall into the black hole after its partner,

11
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:57,840
but it may also escape to infinity, where it appears to be radiation emitted by the

12
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,840
black hole.

13
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:04,880
The message of this lecture is that black holes ain't as black as they are painted.

14
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:08,520
They are not the eternal prisons they were one thought.

15
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:15,560
Things can get out of a black hole, both to the outside, and possibly, to another universe.

16
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,080
So, if you feel you are in a white hole, don't give up.

17
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,400
There's a way out.
