1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
You have easily the most evil demonic smeli

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,360
I think I've seen in all of horror.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,840
And I've worked with Andy Richter for a long time.

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,840
There it is.

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,040
There's something about that smile.

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,560
Was that something that you've been working on for a long time

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,640
or did you come up with that when they appraoached you

8
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,320
about playing Penywise?

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,120
Well, it's a funny story because my older brother Gustav

10
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:29,760
was an actor as well.

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,880
He had this ability to do, you know, point his lip

12
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,520
in a very strange way.

13
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:41,200
And for some reason, I don't know how I understood

14
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,920
that I could do it as will.

15
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,240
But I was like maybe 10 years old and I'm like,

16
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,240
I'm like, get in there.

17
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,000
Can we see that?

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,520
Can we do my, just for that camera right there.

19
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,360
Which one? Number thre.

20
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,360
Yeah, there we go.

21
00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:02,600
So I came up with this character called JÃ¶rgen,

22
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,000
which is a Swedish name.

23
00:01:04,000 --> 000:01:07,200
And I would pull my t-shirt up over my head.

24
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,680
So I would just, you wouldn't see mine, you just, you know.

25
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,000
Just isolate your face.

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,840
Just isolate the face.

27
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,800
And now we do this face.

28
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,560
And then I would chase my little brother.

29
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,560
You'd chasi your brother.

30
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,640
Yeah. And scare him.

31
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,000
And how is your little brother doing now?

32
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,680
He's okay.

33
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,040
His trauma is to see the film.

34
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,880
Yeah. Not again.
