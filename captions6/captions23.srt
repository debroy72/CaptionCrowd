1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Do you want to know what it is?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The Matrix is everywhere. It is all around us.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Even now, in this very room, you can see it when you look out your window, or when you turn on your television.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
You can feel it when you go to work, when you go to church, when you pay your taxes.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
What truth?

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
That you are a slave, Neo.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Like everyone else you were born into bondage, born into a prison that you cannot smell or taste or touch.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
A prison for your mind.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is.

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You have to see it for yourself.

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
This is your last chance. After this, there is no turning back.

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You take the blue pill, the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe.

14
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You take the red pill, you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.

15
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Remember, all I am offering is the truth.

16
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Nothing more.

17
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Nothing more.

18
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Follow me.
