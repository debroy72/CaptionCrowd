Hi, I'm Dominic Colenso and in this video I want to talk to you about how to start your

2
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,880
pitch or presentation.

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,120
This here takes about seven seconds to make a first impression and that doesn't mean

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:20,360
to say that if you do things wrong, if you kind of mess things up, you can't get it back

5
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:25,960
but what it does give us is a very clear window of opportunity to get our audience engaged

6
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,640
on the side and listening to what we have to say.

7
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:35,760
So the kind of most important thing to think about really is not to be boring.

8
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,960
Now what do I mean by that?

9
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,640
I mean don't do what everyone else does.

10
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:45,160
I've sat through so many presentations where I've listened to someone say, good afternoon

11
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,960
everybody or good evening everybody or good morning everybody.

12
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,880
My name's Dominic, I'm from Inflow Training and I'm here today to talk to you about, well

13
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,960
if you're here today to talk to me about then just talk to me about it, get on with

14
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,960
it, get in there and tell me the interesting stuff that's going to get my attention.

15
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,200
So what I'd recommend you do is this, I'd recommend that you start with a bang.

16
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,520
I recommend that you do something a little bit different.

17
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,600
I don't mean do anything crazy or pull a big stunt.

18
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:19,000
What I do mean is start, instead of all that preamble, that good morning, good afternoon,

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,240
start with a fact, with a figure, with a quote, with a story, maybe a bit of video or a bit

20
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:33,120
of music, something that's going to grab the audience's attention and really get them engaged.

21
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:37,600
Because what we don't want them doing, and this is what I see in so many speeches and

22
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:43,920
presentations is while the speakers are starting to speak, the audience are spending the first

23
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,880
couple of minutes just finishing their emails or their text messages on their smartphones.

24
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:55,120
And what we want people to do is to realise that you've started and to start paying attention

25
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,560
to what it is you're talking about.

26
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:02,680
So as far as I'm concerned, that's the secret to starting your pitch or your presentation.

27
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:07,440
It's to start with a bang, grab your audience's attention, dispense with all the niceties

28
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,320
and get them to engage with what you're saying straight away.

29
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,120
I hope you've enjoyed the video.

That's where all the good stuff is.

35
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,680
Until the next time, keep shining.
