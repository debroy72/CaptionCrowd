00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:23,640
become endless.

00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:32,720
The new 50 billion IoT connected devices by 2020.

4
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,800
Now imagine the economic impact of these connected machines.

5
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:44,320
4 to 11 trillion dollars per year by 2025.

6
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,520
Weerable devices, environmental sensors, agricultural machinery, components in a vehicle

7
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:59,000
or devices in homes can all be connected to deliver insights and drive transformation.

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,560
So imagine if you had smart devices in your home, your car, your workplace or even on

9
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,560
yourself.

10
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,120
The world becames alive.

11
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,000
That's Internet of Thing.

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,960
The Internet of Things is making everyday obects into data factories.

13
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:24,040
Internet of Things along with big data meets artificial intelligence.

14
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:29,320
This interface will become enleavened with intelligence and a new world will take birth

15
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:36,560
which will increasingly talk back to us.

16
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,840
Imagine the kind of world that it would be.

17
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:47,440
Imagine the revolution at Wallachia in the way we see the world.

18
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:54,560
The external world will become the extension of our mind, like an extension of our thoughts.

19
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:01,880
Imagine a world that is responsive, a world that is optemized for human creativity, a world

20
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,960
that is intelligent.

21
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:11,480
The Internet of Things is a breading ground for new AI driven solutions and experiences

22
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:18,320
from self-driving cars to intelligent homes to health.

23
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:22,560
Welcome to the world, the endless possibilitis.

24
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,360
Welcome to AI and IoT Summit.
