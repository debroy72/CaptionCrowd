1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Greg.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,340
Oh, my God.

3
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:04,340
Greg!

4
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:05,840
Huh?

5
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:06,840
What?

6
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:07,840
What are you doing? Get up.

7
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,340
Mom and Dad have been calling you for now.

8
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:10,840
You're about to be late for your first day of middle school.

9
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,840
What?

10
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:13,840
Oh, jeez.

11
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:14,840
How'd that happen?

12
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:15,840
Go, go, go.

13
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:16,840
Mom's with the flip out.

14
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,340
She said she'd get you once she waits in the car.

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
37

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
What are you doing?

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
What's going on?

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Get him ready for...

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
School.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Are you insane?

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
School doesn't start till next week.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
In FYI, school doesn't start at 4 o'clock in the morning.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You woke up Manny.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And if he doesn't go back down, good morning.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
There is no way he is going back down.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I just wanted to sleep till 6.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Mommy!

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I got him.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Greg, what are you doing up making all this noise?

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It was Roderick.

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
He woke me up.

32
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
He changed my clock.

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
But I swear, he was just...

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Go to bed.

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Ah.

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
What is that smell?

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I can't even identify it.
