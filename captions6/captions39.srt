00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,040
Olympic National Park contains three distinct ecosystems. The first is the western seaboard

2
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,880
on the Pacific Ocean, where rocky cliffs and sea stacks punctuate sandy beaches strewn with

3
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,760
driftwood.

4
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,320
Ruby Beach is typical of Olympic's rugged coastline. Sea stack rocks and tide pools

5
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:34,640
rich with marine life.

6
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:41,160
Further inland, primeval forests dominate the landscape. On average, they receive 150

7
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:50,280
inches of precipitation per year, making it the only deciduous rainforest on the continent.

8
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,440
And at the heart of Olympic National Park, the third ecosystem is found in the towering

9
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,600
Olympic Mountains.

10
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,960
Any one of this trio, seashore, forest and mountains, would be worthy of National Park

11
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,520
Service protection. The combination of these three biomes makes this fresh and vibrant

12
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,520
land startlingly unique.
