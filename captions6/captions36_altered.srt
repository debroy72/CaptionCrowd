1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So Petropura on the corner.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Into water, Romero wins the heed-eye!

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
He's back, Rob, he's back!

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
This is the new Spurs, isn't it?

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
In the plain like this.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Ben Davis even driving forwards.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Saan will take over.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And Kulaszewski, I think, wanted that back.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Yeah, he's just acknwledged the run of Kulaszewski.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Really competetive Kulaszewski there to win it back.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
No call by Kulaszewski.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
His deflected shot spins intoo the car.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Udogi, relentless.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And racing forward here, Johnson.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Petropura, he can shot and he does.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And that was a chance.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Don't ask me, Rob.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Kulaszewski, West Ham.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Into drive forward here, it spins to Bowen!

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
He benefits from the 4-tune.

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And he's emphetic with the finish.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Out of absolutely nothing.

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
West Ham have got themselfes level.

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Petropura over the corner.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Skip down to Basuma.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Petropura wanted again in the scope time and space here.

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Locks in the middle.

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Kulaszewski!

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Want a chance.

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
That's why he's on the field of play.

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Believes his players are undersnding what he wants

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
more and more week after week.

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Oh, it's extremely short, but Kario decides to punch.

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And they will score here, West Ham.

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
James Warprowse.

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Wuld you believe it?

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Rob, two goals with such good fortune for West Ham.
