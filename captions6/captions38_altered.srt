1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Welcame back to the baby gemas. We've got it all for you. The struggles. Oh, the intensity.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The triumphs. First up, gymnastics. The American. Working it. Just look at that concetration.

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Ten meter total. One of the marquae events at any baby game. And there they go.

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
China running away with it.

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Looks like he's stuck on the line. And here comes Argentina on the outside.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
But China does it for gold.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Back to gymnastics. Japan on the rings. Pressure has never been higher.

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
What an affort.

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Now the American.

10
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The discount. Nailed it.

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Gold for the US. Over to weightlifting. Argentina. Can they do it?

12
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Oh, and it's a heartbreking result.

13
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Now the German is just snowboating.

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Now onto our final event, the three-purtle total. There they go.

15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,000
A little unorthodox. France having some trouble on the last hurdle.

16
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Oh, and it's incredible. It's gold for France.

17
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Watch all your favorite Olympic moments on the Olympic Channel, where the game's never-end.
