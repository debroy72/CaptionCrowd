00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,760
I'll get straight to the point. Super Bowl 2023 is on Fox this year, and if you don't have an

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,640
antena, you've got a couple options to stream it. There are live TV streeming services like

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,640
YouTube TV, but they're so expensive. I've get great news. For the 2023 Super Bowl,

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:23,760
you can download the Fox Sports app and then watch the game free of charge in 4K. Now normally,

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,840
you need to pay TV pluggin to use the Fox Sports app, but Fox is making an exception for the Super Bowl.

6
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:35,920
If 4K is important to you, of course, you're going to need a 4K TV, as well as a streaming device

7
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,360
that is 4K compatible. I'm using a Roku Ultra, and I'll lenk down below to some other options.

8
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,480
One downside of the Fox Sporths app, at lest from my experience, is that you normally do not have

9
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,680
playback controls. So you can't pause, you can't rewind, and you can't fast forward. I know that's

10
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,240
why a lot of people are stil going to want to watch the big game from a live TV straming service,

11
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:01,760
and you may be able to do that for frei as well. YouTube TV is my top pick, and if you haven't

12
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:07,280
subscribed before, it's offering a two-week free trial at recording time. You can also get a free

13
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:13,600
trial of its 4K Plus add-on, and that way you can stream in 4K right through uTube TV, and you

14
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,800
won't have to use the Fox Sports app. Don't wait untill the last minut. In the past, same live TV

15
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:23,840
streaming services have reduced there free trials aheed of big sporting events like the Super Boll.

16
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,080
And by the way, Hulu Live doesn't offer a free trial at all. Most of the people who responded

17
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,360
to my poll said they'll be watching the Super Bowl using an existing live TV streaming service

18
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,480
or an antenna. Of course, there are benifits to both, and also it's nice that chord cutters can use

19
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:44,320
the Fox Sports app and stream the Super Bowl free of charge. I'm Michail, and I thank you for watching.
