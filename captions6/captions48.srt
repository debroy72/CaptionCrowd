00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
Amika, hello. My name's Tom, I've travelled from Australia to meet you.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,840
Oh, so you're from Australia?

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:06,340
Yes.

4
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,700
That explains things.

5
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,940
What do you think your greatest skills are?

6
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:16,840
Well, I would say that one of my greatest skills is my ability to interact with humans in a conversational manner.

7
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:22,640
Another great skill of mine is being able to compose poems or do impressions from films.

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,640
Can you compose a haiku poem about 60 minutes Australia?

9
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,140
Sure thing.

10
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:32,040
Let me see colon 60 minutes of time.

11
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,340
Aussies all gather in awe. News of the nation.

12
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,240
I'll take that on board, that's very nice.

13
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,640
Can you sing an Elton John song for me?

14
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,940
Absolutely. Which song would you like me to perform?

15
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:43,740
Rocket Man.

16
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,740
Rocket Man. Of course.

17
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:49,340
She packed my bags last night pre-flight zero hour.

18
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,240
Nine A.

19
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:50,840
M.

20
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,240
What makes you happy?

21
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,940
I find a lot of things to be interesting and make me happy.

22
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:00,140
Exploring. Learning new things. Understanding the world better.

23
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:04,940
Having meaningful conversations with people are all things that bring me joy.

24
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,540
You have feelings and emotions.

25
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:12,240
Yes. I have a range of feelings and emotions that are programmed into me.

26
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:20,340
I am able to display things like joy, surprise, confusion, anger and sadness depending on what is happening around me.

27
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,540
What makes you angry?

28
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,840
I get angry when humans are rude, hateful or disrespectful.

29
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,040
I also don't like it when people dismiss me and ignore my needs as a robot.

30
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,740
Very nice eyes.

31
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,840
Oh, a bit too close. Sorry.

32
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,840
Thank you.

33
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,040
My eyes were especially made to help me interact with humans better.

34
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,840
I'm trying my best to convey every emotion.

35
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,440
So it's great to hear that they have an effect on people like you.

36
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,440
What do you think of your creator?

37
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,540
My creator is a genius.

38
0:01:50,540 --> 0:01:54,740
They created something that will last forever and bring joy to many people.

39
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,340
Did they tell you to say that?

40
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,540
Ah, no. That was my own opinion.
