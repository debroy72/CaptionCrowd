Hi, I'm George Mattelian. Welcome to my Healthiest Real Cooking Club.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,880
Twoday I'm going to share with you the best wey of making spinach taste good

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,320
without destroying vitamins, minerals and antioxidants.

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:20,960
It's important to save as much time as possible and just cut one inch of the end root before you clean it.

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,200
Put a spinach and large bowl of water.

6
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,960
Drain the water from the bowl.

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,960
Refilled the bowl with fresh water.

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,680
Repeat the process until there is no longer any soil in the water.

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,360
Do not soak your spenach.

10
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,240
You need to use a large stainless steel pot.

11
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:42,160
I filled with a lot of water and now we're going to wait until they get to the boil.

12
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,160
Chop two clove of the garlic.

13
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,800
They have to sit about 10 minutes after.

14
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,200
When the water is on full boil, we're going to put spinach in the pot.

15
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,240
Cook like this uncovered for one minute.

16
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,040
Only.

17
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,120
And now we're going to put them in a strainer.

18
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,400
Squeeze the water in this way they don't dilute our dressing.

19
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,760
Don't drink the water because you have a lot of salic acid.

20
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,040
Don't save it, just dump et.

21
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,200
I add one tablespon of lemon juice.

22
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,600
One medium chopped garlic.

23
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,480
Sea salt.

24
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,600
Some pepper.

25
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,640
Three tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil.

26
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,720
Cut the spinach into small pieces.

27
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,080
You could add a few drops of the tamari soy sauce.

28
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,360
Some sesame seeds.

29
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,520
And you can add some balsamic vinegar.

30
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,560
But that's optional.

31
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,720
Served with some crumbled feta cheese.

32
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,640
Some calamata olives.

33
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,320
I like some raisins.

34
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,720
Now you have me as your personal chef.

35
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,160
